## Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

###Project

The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###Files

- `CodeBook.MD`, code book that describes the data and the transformations made to the data in order to obtain a tidy data set. 
- `run_analysis.R`, actual code used to create the tidy data set as outlined in the 5 guidelines above.
- `secTidySet.txt`, tidy data set.
